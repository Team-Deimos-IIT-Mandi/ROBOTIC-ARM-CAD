# ROBOTIC-ARM-CAD
This repository contains the SolidWorks models and render images of a 7-DOF robotic arm designed for a Mars rover. The arm is capable of high flexibility and precision, making it suitable for sample collection, instrument placement, and manipulation tasks. Each folder includes the design files (.SLDPRT, .SLDASM) along with rendered previews.
## 📖 Project Overview

This 6 DOF robotic arm is designed with precise articulation and smooth motion control.  
Each joint provides independent movement, enabling the arm to perform complex tasks such as:  

- Object picking and placing  
- Path following and trajectory planning  
- Simulation and control experiments  
- Integration with ROS / microcontrollers  

The modular design allows easy upgrades, sensor integration, and different end-effectors (like grippers or tools).

## ⚙️ Features

- **6 Degrees of Freedom** → Full range of motion (base rotation, shoulder, elbow, wrist pitch, wrist roll, and gripper).  
- **Scalable Design** → Can be built in different sizes using standard servo/stepper motors.  
- **CAD + Simulation Ready** → Designed in SolidWorks (with URDF export support for ROS).  
- **Easy Control** → Supports Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, or ROS-based control.  
- **Customizable** → End-effector can be swapped for grippers, pens, or tools.
