# ROBOTIC-ARM-CAD
This repository contains the SolidWorks models and render images of a 7-DOF robotic arm designed for a Mars rover. The arm is capable of high flexibility and precision, making it suitable for sample collection, instrument placement, and manipulation tasks. Each folder includes the design files (.SLDPRT, .SLDASM) along with rendered previews.
